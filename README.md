## Features
Keyboard Interaction: The drum kit responds to specific key presses on the user's keyboard. Each key is associated with a different drum sound, providing an immersive and interactive drumming experience.

**Dynamic UI:** When a key is pressed, the corresponding drum element on the user interface visually responds with animation and styling changes, mimicking the action of playing a real drum.

**Audio Playback:** The project utilizes the HTML5 <audio> element to play drum sounds. Each key corresponds to a different audio clip, allowing users to hear the sound of the drum they played.

**Event Handling:** JavaScript event listeners are employed to detect key presses and trigger the appropriate actions, such as playing the corresponding audio clip and animating the drum element.
